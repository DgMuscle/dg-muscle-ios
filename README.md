This project is purely an app I made to use. I focused on simple UI and features, and the purpose is only to increase muscle mass.

I will create a window where anyone who uses this app can easily make bug reports and feature suggestions, and I will also use it as a springboard for learning good code.

The key to this app is, to put it simply, to record the exercise while referring to the previous exercise record so that you can exercise a little stronger than the previous performance when doing a specific exercise.
