This project is purely an app I made to use. I focused on simple UI and features, and the purpose is only to increase muscle mass.

I will create a window where anyone who uses this app can easily make bug reports and feature suggestions, and I will also use it as a springboard for learning good code.

The key to this app is, to put it simply, to record the exercise while referring to the previous exercise record so that you can exercise a little stronger than the previous performance when doing a specific exercise.

I will suggest simple guide line for how to use this app.

<b>At first, you have to make your own exercise list.</b>

1. Go to setting page by tapping your profile button in home screen.

2. You have two options to create your own exercise list exercise, exercise guide button. The Exercise guide button suggests several representative exercises and makes it easy to add them to your workout list. If you want to create custom exercise, tap the exercise button.
3. You can add by tapping the Add button.
4. Write down the name of the exercise and select the part you want to develop through the exercise. You can select multiple parts. Enabling Favourite helps you find the exercise more easily when you add records later.

   
<b>Now let's add exercise history</b>

_One exercise history can be filled one per day and consists of several exercise records._

1. Tap the "add history" button in home screen.
2. Tap the "Add" button
3. Select exercise
   - If you don't have your own exercise list, don't worry. You can add by tapping "add" button.
4. Then you can see "Add" button. Tap that button, write down the weight and the number of times.
5. After you added at least one set, then you can see something like placeholder under the your last set.

   You can easily add your new set by tapping that.
   
6. If there's a previous record of the same kind of exercise, you can see how much more or less exercise you have done compared to before and can see previous record by tapping "Go to see previous record" button.

Now, go grow your musclesðŸ’ª
